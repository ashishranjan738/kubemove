Workloads running on Kubernetes do not make assumptions about the underlying infrastructure. However,  it is still non-trivial to move them across different clusters. It is also non trivial to move them to another namespace within the same cluster scope such as to a different zone. KubeMove provides a set of tools and API to coordinate the orchestration and workflow of moving an application in production across cluster or namespace boundaries. 



# Using Kubemove

- Install kubemove using helm - `helm install kubemove.io/kubemove`
- Annotate the application to be moved with `kubemove.io/kubemove.enable="true"`
- Use `MoveEngine` API with the required configuration to start the data movement or sync
- Wait for the movement or datasync to complete  and switch the application on the target cluster using `MoveSwitch` API

# CLI

`kubectl km move init <app> <target end point>`

`kubectl km move switch <movepair>`



# Use cases

- Hybrid and multi-cloud deployments - Move applications on-prem to cloud or vice-versa or from cloud-cloud
- Onramp to Kubernetes - KubeMove can help migrate the data from legacy volumes onto Kubernetes
- Kubernetes and/or application upgrades - Applications may need to be moved back and forth while following blue green strategy
